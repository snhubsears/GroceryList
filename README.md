# GroceryList
Project 3's Grocery List C++/Python

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project uses C++ and Python together to identify and display quantities of products purchased in a grocery list. The user can choose to display the quantity of all products, one particular product, a histogram of the products' quantities, or quit the application. 

What did you do particularly well?
I think I was able to successfully follow the instructions to the intended purpose. The goal of this project, as I see it, was to use C++ to handle user interaction and Python to handle file and data processing, and I think I accomplished that task to full function.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
There are few things I think I personally could improve without extra learning. One adjustment I think would increase performance efficiency is using switch case instead of just if/then statements.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Due to my insufficient memory, reading and writing files in Python was likely the most difficult piece of this relatively simple project. I worked through it by looking up the basics and adapting it to my code.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
In my first attempt at this project, I tried to use C++ to read and write the frequency.dat file, then sent it to Python. The process for sending an array of strings converted into a Python tuple was troublesome to figure out, but in doing so I learned quite a bit about the given Python functions including the parameters in Py_BuildValue. This information and recalling the previous Python syntax should be transferable to future projects and understanding.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I used comments, loops, and custom functions to reduce code redundancy and allow easier modulation that could be freely pieced together.
